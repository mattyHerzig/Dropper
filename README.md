## About the Project
The idea for creating FoodDropper came about when I wanted to make a Minecraft mod that would be really good for a YouTube video. At the time, those gimmicky SMPs were trending, such as [LifeSteal SMP](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lifesteal+smp). I thought that having one dropper in the world that provided the sole source of food would make for a good video, since whoever controls the dropper, effectively controls everyone. It'd make for some good plots, moments, etc.

The java files that the plugin is made of are located at `src/main/java/me/matty/variety`. On a side note, the word "variety" is used a lot in the files. That's just because it's the temporary word I used before having come up with a proper idea for the project.
